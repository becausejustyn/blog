        "One of my favourite models that I have come across is the [Elo ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system). In short, it is a system that can be applied to pairwise matchups such as teams or players. It is quite popular across different domains such as chess, education, chess, online gaming, and many more. I like it because it was the first time I tried adjusting a formula with some knowledge about the topic that I wanted to focus on. Elo updates after every single game a player or team participates in. Because a team can only play the teams on their schedule in sport, Elo allows us to reduce some of the uncertainty to how good a particular team is. Another nice feature of Elo is that it rewards teams more for beating a good team, and punishes good teams for losing to bad teams[^1].\n",

This does not matter too much, however, I like to keep this at $400$ so comparing different Elo methods is apples to apples. \n"
